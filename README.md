# Web Monetization Video Stream

Allows users of Web Monetization enabled services like
[Flat](https://getflat.com) to pay for a video stream. As money is sent to the
server, it authorizes the stream to send more seconds of video.

## Test it out

Assumes you're running [Moneyd](https://github.com/interledgerjs/moneyd-xrp) and
have a Web Monetization extension like [Minute](https://github.com/sharafian/minute)
or [Flat](https://getflat.com).

Follow their instructions if you don't already have them set up.

```
git clone https://github.com/sharafian/web-monetization-video-stream.git
cd web-monetization-video-stream
npm install
npm start
# Now go to localhost:8080
```
